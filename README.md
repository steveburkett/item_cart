Playing around w/ react-rails 

# to build
1)  bundle
1)  be rake db:migrate
1)  be rake db:seed (optional)
1)  be rails s

  
#Why use react
1) UI componentization
1) UI parts in one place (instead of jquery/rails partials spread around)
1) easier to test (jasmine/phantom & react test helpers)
1) Reactâ€™s VDOM and Dom diffs are faster than rails-ajax-DOM manipulation
1) low learning curve:  basic react is fast to learn
1) bottom line: deliver (non-trivial) reactive front-end UI faster
